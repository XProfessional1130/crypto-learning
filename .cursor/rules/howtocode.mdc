# Coding workflow preference

- Focus on areas of cdoe relevant to the task
- Don't touch code that is not related to the task
- Write thorough tests for major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns or the architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other areas or features may be affected by code changes
