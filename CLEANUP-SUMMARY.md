# Project Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

### Log Files
- ✅ Removed `compile-errors.log`
- ✅ Removed `import-fixes.log`
- ✅ Removed `remaining-migration.log`
- ✅ Removed `component-migration.log`
- ✅ Removed `conflict-resolution.log`
- ✅ Removed `import-updates.log`

### SQL Files
- ✅ Removed redundant `auth-subscriptions-fix.sql`
- ✅ Removed redundant `drop-user-triggers.sql`
- ✅ Removed redundant `fix-recovery-triggers.sql`

### Temporary Files
- ✅ Removed empty `main` file
- ✅ Removed empty `migrations` directory

### Migration Scripts
- ✅ Removed `scripts/fix-component-imports.sh`
- ✅ Removed `scripts/migrate-components.sh`
- ✅ Removed `scripts/migrate-remaining-components.sh`
- ✅ Removed `scripts/resolve-component-conflicts.sh`
- ✅ Removed `scripts/update-component-imports.sh`

## Code Improvements

### Security Improvements
- ✅ Removed hardcoded credentials from `scripts/fix-database.js`
- ✅ Updated scripts to use environment variables

### New Setup Tools
- ✅ Created comprehensive `scripts/clean-setup.js` script
- ✅ Updated `check-env.js` to verify all required environment variables
- ✅ Added `setup` command to package.json
- ✅ Updated README.md with setup instructions

## Benefits

1. **Improved Security**: Removed hardcoded credentials and moved to environment variables.
2. **Reduced Clutter**: Removed unnecessary files and logs to make the codebase cleaner.
3. **Simplified Setup**: Created a unified setup script that verifies the environment and runs necessary migrations.
4. **Better Documentation**: Added clear setup instructions in the README.

## Next Steps

1. Run the setup script when deploying to a new environment:
   ```
   npm run setup
   ```

2. Make sure to check the environment variables with:
   ```
   node check-env.js
   ```

3. If the database setup fails, follow the manual database setup instructions:
   - Enable pgrest extension in Supabase
   - Run the migrations in the SQL editor

The project should now be cleaner, more secure, and easier to set up.
