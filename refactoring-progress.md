## Notes

### Codebase Structure Findings
- The app uses a mix of Next.js Pages Router (/pages) and App Router (/app)
- Components organized in different locations: /components and /app/components
- Extensive use of hooks in /lib/hooks and /app/hooks
- Component architecture uses atoms, molecules, organisms pattern in /app/components

### Issues Identified
1. **Overly Large Components:**
   - ChatModal.tsx (570 lines)
   - Navigation.tsx (212 lines)

2. **Overly Large Hooks:**
   - useAssistantChat.ts (791 lines)
   - useWatchlist.ts (492 lines)
   - usePortfolio.ts (456 lines)
   - useTeamWatchlist.ts (389 lines)
   - useTeamPortfolio.ts (353 lines)

3. **Mixed Concerns:**
   - Large components likely mixing UI and logic
   - Long hook files may be handling too many responsibilities

## Detailed Refactoring Plan

### 1. Refactor ChatModal Component
The ChatModal component is 570 lines long and handles many responsibilities. We've broken it down into:

- ✅ **ChatModalContainer**: Main container with layout and state management
- ✅ **ChatInput**: Input field and submission logic  
- ✅ **ChatControls**: Buttons and controls for chat actions
- ✅ **ChatHeader**: Header with personality switching and controls
- ✅ **ChatMessages**: Message display and interaction
- ✅ **utils.ts**: Shared utilities and data

### 2. Refactor useAssistantChat Hook
This hook is 791 lines and has been split into multiple focused hooks:

- ✅ **useChat**: Basic chat functionality
- ✅ **useChatTyping**: Animation and typing logic
- ✅ **useChatHistory**: Thread loading and history management 
- ✅ **usePersonality**: Personality switching and management
- ✅ **useChatAPI**: API communication logic
- ✅ **useAssistantChat**: Main hook that combines all the specialized hooks

### 3. Refactor Navigation Component
The Navigation component is 212 lines and has been split into:

- ✅ **NavigationContainer**: Main container with layout and state management
- ✅ **DesktopMenu**: Desktop navigation links and auth buttons
- ✅ **MobileMenu**: Mobile navigation drawer with animation

### 4. Refactor useWatchlist Hook
The useWatchlist hook is 492 lines and has been split into:

- ✅ **useWatchlistData**: Database operations for watchlist items
- ✅ **usePriceData**: Price data fetching and caching
- ✅ **useWatchlist**: Main hook that combines the specialized hooks

### 5. Refactor usePortfolio Hook
The usePortfolio hook is 456 lines and has been split into:

- ✅ **usePortfolioData**: Fetching and caching portfolio data
- ✅ **usePortfolioActions**: Adding, updating, and removing portfolio items
- ✅ **usePortfolioUtils**: Currency preferences and coin search functionality
- ✅ **usePortfolio**: Main hook that combines the specialized hooks

### 6. Refactor useTeamWatchlist Hook
The useTeamWatchlist hook is 389 lines and has been split into:

- ✅ **useTeamWatchlistData**: Fetching and caching team watchlist data
- ✅ **useTeamWatchlistActions**: Adding, updating, and removing team watchlist items
- ✅ **useTeamWatchlistUtils**: Utility functions for team watchlist data
- ✅ **useTeamWatchlist**: Main hook that combines the specialized hooks

### 7. Refactor useTeamPortfolio Hook
The useTeamPortfolio hook is 353 lines and has been split into:

- ✅ **useTeamPortfolioData**: Fetching and caching team portfolio data
- ✅ **useTeamPortfolioActions**: Adding, updating, and removing team portfolio items
- ✅ **useTeamPortfolio**: Main hook that combines the specialized hooks

### 8. Implement Error Handling and Logging
- ✅ Add consistent error handling with ErrorBoundary component
- ✅ Implement proper error states with ErrorDisplay component
- ✅ Add loading states with LoadingSpinner component
- ✅ Create logger utility for standardized logging
- ⬜ Integrate error handling into remaining components

### 9. Performance Improvements
- ⬜ Optimize rendering with React.memo and useMemo
- ⬜ Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- ⬜ Add proper loading states
- ⬜ Optimize API calls

### 10. Standardize Component Structure
- ⬜ Ensure consistent component architecture across the app
- ⬜ Use the atomic design approach consistently
- ⬜ Organize component files logically

### 11. Document the Codebase
- ⬜ Add JSDoc comments to all components and hooks
- ⬜ Create documentation for component usage
- ⬜ Document architectural decisions

## Implementation Order

1. ✅ Break down ChatModal.tsx into smaller components
2. ✅ Refactor useAssistantChat.ts into smaller, focused hooks
3. ✅ Refactor Navigation.tsx into smaller components
4. ✅ Add error handling and logging utilities
5. ✅ Extract business logic from useWatchlist.ts
6. ✅ Extract business logic from usePortfolio.ts
7. ✅ Extract business logic from useTeamWatchlist.ts
8. ✅ Extract business logic from useTeamPortfolio.ts
9. ⬜ Implement performance optimizations
10. ⬜ Document all changes and components

## Current Challenges

1. **Integration with Existing Components**: The refactored components need to work with existing components like MessageBubble which have specific prop requirements.
2. **Type Compatibility**: Ensuring type safety across the refactored components.
3. **Maintaining Functionality**: Ensuring all original functionality is preserved while improving the code structure.

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller, focused components and hooks are easier to understand and maintain.
2. **Better Testability**: Isolated functionality is easier to test.
3. **Enhanced Reusability**: Specialized hooks can be reused across the application.
4. **Clearer Separation of Concerns**: UI components focus on rendering, hooks handle logic.
5. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can understand the codebase more quickly.
6. **Better Error Handling**: Standardized approach to error handling improves user experience.
7. **Consistent Loading States**: Unified loading indicators provide better feedback to users.
