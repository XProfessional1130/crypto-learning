# App Router Migration Documentation

## Overview

This project has been successfully migrated from using a mix of Next.js Pages Router and App Router to using only the App Router. This document serves as a record of the migration process and provides guidance for future updates.

## Migration Summary

1. **API Routes Migration**:
   - All API routes were migrated from `/pages/api/*` to `/app/api/*/route.ts`
   - Updated to use `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` from 'next/server'
   - Changed from default exports to named exports for HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)

2. **Client-Side Code Updates**:
   - Router imports updated from 'next/router' to 'next/navigation'
   - All client components updated to use App Router patterns for navigation

3. **Final Cleanup**:
   - Ran the `scripts/finalize-app-router-migration.sh` script to:
     - Remove the Pages Router directory
     - Update next.config.js to fully embrace App Router
     - Add a note to the refactoring-progress.md file

4. **Testing**:
   - All API routes tested and verified working
   - Authentication flows tested
   - Navigation and page transitions verified

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Server Components**: Improved performance with React Server Components
2. **Simplified Data Fetching**: More intuitive data fetching patterns
3. **Nested Layouts**: Better composition of UI elements
4. **Loading and Error States**: Built-in loading and error handling
5. **Route Groups**: Logical organization of routes
6. **Future-Proof**: Aligned with Next.js's future direction

## Important Notes for Future Development

1. **Imports**: Always use `next/navigation` for routing imports, not `next/router`
2. **API Routes**: Create new API routes in `/app/api/*/route.ts` using the named export pattern
3. **Server vs. Client Components**: Be mindful of the distinction between client and server components
   - Client components must use the `'use client'` directive at the top of the file
   - Server components should not import client-only APIs
